# MindBoard
A way to organize info with many-to-many relations!

---

This project is a culmination of many of my previous projects. This is a major project of mine and I will expand it as time goes on!

The goal is to build a way to link any sort of information - to-do lists, worries, thoughts, personal knowledge, etc, into columns so that you can quickly see at a glance that X is related to Y, but is also the grandchild of W, but is also a sibling to T, for example. Many mind maps make this too complex - and this is an alternative.

FINISHED:
- nodes show up now!
- relations seem to be calculating correctly
- the test suite is looking great!

NEXT:
- Will update this on github projects!
- nodes need to be made!
